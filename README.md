# Tax Calculator

This code is designed to practice approaches to CI and CD in a boot camp. It is a simplified implementation of the rules for UK vehicle tax as of 2017 (the full rules can be found here https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax-rate-tables).

## Preparation

It is critical that you can push changes to github.com. Check you can by logging out and logging in again. You will need to have a git client installed. In addition, there are language specific steps below.

1. Fork the project.
1. Do not clone the project using your IDE as you’ll end up opening/importing the root directory. Clone your fork from the command line by running `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tax_calculator`
1. Complete the language specific set up to get your environment working:
    * [Java](exercises/java)
    * [JavaScript](exercises/javascript)
    * [.NET](exercises/dotnet)

That’s all in terms of preparation. Please don’t read ahead, as you’ll get the most out of the boot camp if you haven’t already read the material.

## The rules for use in the exercises are summarized below:
